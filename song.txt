They say
You know when you know
So let's face it, you had me at hello
Hesitation never helps
How could this be anything, anything else?

When all I dream of is your eyes
All I long for is your touch
And, darlin', something tells me that's enough, mm
You can say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much
But I think they call this love

One smile, one kiss, two lonely hearts is all that it takes
Now baby, you're on my mind, every night, every day
Good vibrations getting loud
How could this be anything, anything else?
