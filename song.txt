They say
You know when you know
So let's face it, you had me at hello
Hesitation never helps
How could this be anything, anything else?

When All I dream of is your eyes
All I long for is your touch
And darling, something tells me that's enough mmm
You can say that I'm a fool
And I don't know very much, but I think they call this Love
